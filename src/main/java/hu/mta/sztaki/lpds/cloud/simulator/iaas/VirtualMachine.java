/**
 * 
 * This class represents a single virtual machine in the system. It simulates
 * its behavior. Currently it supports three approaches for VM image storage:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Local: The VA is expected to be in the PM's repository (caching), the
 * class ensures its cloning and operates on the clone for its entire lifetime.
 * During suspend the memory state is also stored in the PM's repository.
 * <li>Mixed: The VA is expected in a remote repository (e.g. it could reside in
 * the central service in an IaaS). The class creates a local copy of this VA
 * (in the PM's repository) so it can use it during the VM's lifetime. During
 * suspend the memory state is also stored in the PM's repository.
 * <li>Remote: The VA is expected in a remote repository where it is cloned. The
 * VM operates on the remote clone for its lifetime. During suspend the memory
 * state is also stored in the remote repository.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Comparison of the 3 approaches:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Startup: Local could be the slowest if the PM first have to download the
 * VA to its local repo then cloning is needed. However, in case the VA is
 * already in the PM's repo then the Local approach is faster than Mixed because
 * it does not imply external network operations anymore. Remote starts up
 * immediately because there is no transfers are required.
 * <li>Execution: Local and Mixed approaches execute without any disruptions,
 * while the Remote approach continuously uses the network for its disk
 * operations, thus disk&network intensive VMs will suffer significantly.
 * 
 * WARNING: the current implementation does not really reduce the processing
 * speed of a Remote storage based VM. This is future work.
 * <li>Migration: Local and Mixed approaches need to transfer both the memory
 * state and the disk image for the VM. In contrast, the Remote approach only
 * transfers the memory state between the new PM and the old one. Thus migration
 * is almost instant compared to the other two approaches.
 * </ul>
